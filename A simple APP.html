<h3>Brief introduction</h3>
<p>Arabic language is famous for its complicated numeral-noun construction. You can refer to <a href="https://www.learnarabiconline.com/arabic-numbers/">this link</a> for details about numeral-noun construction and <a href="https://www.learnarabiconline.com/arabic-grammar-introduction/">this link</a> for details about intricate but also intriguing Arabic grammar.</p>

<p>Since I was then commissary in charge of studies in my class and I had the responsibility to help others practice this complicated numeral-noun construction with ease, I designed a VB-based APP in Grade 4, where the users can do exercises of Arabic Numeral Phrases.</p>

<h3>Here's user interface of this APP</h3>
