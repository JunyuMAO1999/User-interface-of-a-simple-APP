<h3>Brief introduction</h3>
<p>Arabic language is famous for its complicated numeral-noun construction. You can refer to <a href="https://www.learnarabiconline.com/arabic-numbers/">this link</a> for details about numeral-noun construction and <a href="https://www.learnarabiconline.com/arabic-grammar-introduction/">this link</a> for details about intricate but also intriguing Arabic grammar.</p>

<p>Since I was then commissary in charge of studies in my class and I had the responsibility to help others practice this complicated numeral-noun construction with ease, I designed a VB-based APP in Grade 4, where the users can do exercises of Arabic Numeral Phrases.</p>

<h3>Here comes the APP!~</h3>
<p>This is a simple and easy-use application designed by VB, Visual Basic. As you can see, the icon of the APP is as simple as its function. [Lol]</p>
<p>The filename is written in Chinese and it means "Numeral Phrases interpreting exercises assistant for economic and financial texts" in English. </p>

<p>Click on it, and you will see this interface. So middle-eastern it is! [Lol] </p>
<p>The title means "Numeral Phrases interpreting exercises for economic and financial texts".</p>
<p>The button means "Please begin your show". [Lol]&nbsp;(Actually, this was once a piece of internet catchphrases in China.)</p>
<p>The text in the right textbox means "To generate a NOUN in random".</p>
<p>The text in the left textbox means "To generate a NUMBER over 10 thousand in random".&nbsp;(from 10 thousand to 1 million/ 1 billion/ 10 billion/ 100 billion/ 1 trillion respectively)</p>

<p>Click on the button, and you will see the result! </p>
<p>WOW! Simple and easy! </p>

<br/> 

<p>So the users can get the numbers in random and their partner -- the nouns. (In Chinese, there are also measure words preceding the nouns.)</p>
<p>Every measure word comprises ONE character, while every noun comprises TWO characters. </p>
<p>For example, for the first line, “个” is the measure word and “台灯” is the noun which means "table lamp".</p>
